    <!-- ngModel is angular's two way data binding syntax -->
    <!-- Here it is binding to hero.name property to the HTML text box so that data can 
        flow in both directions. Data can flow from the hero.name property to the text 
        box and from the text box back to the hero-name -->
    <!-- Angular needs to know the pieces of the application that fit together and what other 
        files and libraries the application requires - this is called metadata. The @Components 
        decorators has some of the metadata, other critical metadata is in @NgModule. The most 
        import @NgModule decorator annotates the top-level AppModule class (which was created 
        when we did ng new). This is where you opt in to the FormsModule. -->
